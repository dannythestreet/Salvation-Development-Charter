# [ Jojooo. ]: Aspiring Software Engineer 

### Goal/Philosophy:

My goal here is to be around like-minded people who can assist me on my journey to becoming a Software Engineer. I also plan to assist in the community and soon the client + server coding of Salvation as I develop my talents. I always aim to improve as a person and a developer as time elapse and constantly questions the social/technology discussed amongst the staff (as some reading this may already know, lol). Another goal of mine is to add this project on future resumes of mine documenting that I participated in coding projects within a team setting, which is a really beneficial feat to have documented. My community philosophy is quite simple: as long is everyone is at peace with one another moderation isn't needed at all, yet once tension is created between staff v staff, member vs member, etc... Some higher power is needed to police the issue.
